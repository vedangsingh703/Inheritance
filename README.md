# Inheritance
# 🧬 Inheritance in C++
# 🎯 Aim
To understand and implement different types of inheritance in C++, exploring how classes can reuse and extend functionality through hierarchical relationships.

# 📚 Theory
Inheritance is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

It allows a class (called the derived class) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (called the base class).

# 🔑 Key Points

Base Class: The class whose members are inherited.

Derived Class: The class that inherits from the base class.

Access Specifiers:

a. public → Public & protected members of base remain accessible.

b. protected → Public & protected members of base become protected.

c. private → Public & protected members of base become private.

# 🏗️ Types of Inheritance
# Single Inheritance

One base class → One derived class.

Example: Vehicle → Car.

# Multilevel Inheritance

A class derived from another derived class.

Example: University → Department → Lab.

# Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple classes inherit from the same base class.

Example: University → Department, Hostel, Library.

# Multiple Inheritance

A class inherits from more than one base class.

Example: Department → University + Facility.

# Hybrid Inheritance

Combination of two or more types (e.g., hierarchical + multiple).

# 📋 Algorithms
# 🧾 Single Inheritance
    Start
    Define a base class Vehicle with a method color().
    Define a derived class Car that inherits from Vehicle and adds speed().
    In main():
    Create object myCar.
    Call color() and speed().
    End

# 🏗️ Multilevel Inheritance
    Start
    Define base class University with showUni().
    Define derived class Department inheriting University, with showDept().
    Define derived class Lab inheriting Department, with showLab().
    In main():
    Create object VLSI.
    Call all three methods.
    End

# 🌳 Hierarchical Inheritance
    Start
    Define base class University.
    Define three derived classes: Department, Hostel, Library.
    Each derived class has its own method.
    In main():
    Create objects of each derived class.
    Call base + derived methods.
    End

# 🔗 Multiple Inheritance
    Start
    Define base class University.
    Define base class Facility.
    Define derived class Department inheriting from both.
    In main():
    Create object ec.
    Call methods from both base classes + derived class.
    End

# 🌀 Hybrid Inheritance
    Start
    Combine hierarchical + multiple inheritance.
    Example: University as base.
    Department and Hostel inherit from University.
    Lab inherits from Department and also uses Facility.
    In main():
    Create objects and demonstrate combined features.
    End

# 🧠 Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the power of inheritance in C++:

Code Reusability – Base class features are reused in derived classes.

Extensibility – Derived classes can add new features.

Hierarchy Modeling – Real-world relationships (University → Department → Lab) can be represented.

Flexibility – Supports single, multilevel, hierarchical, multiple, and hybrid inheritance.

Inheritance is the foundation for polymorphism and advanced OOP design.
